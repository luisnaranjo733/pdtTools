Each room
---------
* Has an ID number
* Has a capacity
* The above traits will be evaluated a week before the room selection process begins.
  - Whoever is in charge of room selection will evaluate how many people can live in
    each room.
    
  - If a particular member wants to turn an unused room into a room, they will need to
    have that FORMALLY cleared by exec (have to go to an exec meeting for discussion)
    before this evaluation process begins. The room may or may not be reserved for the
    renovator before the room selection process begins.
    
  - If a group of members wants to take a room or group of rooms as a "mini porch"
    (more than 3 people sleeping in one room), they will need to have that cleared
    INFORMALLY (facebook is cool) by exec before this evaluations process begins.
    The room may or may not be reserved for the renovator before the room selection
    process begins.
    
  - Most rooms will be avai 
    
  - All members will be informed of the resulting available rooms.
  
  This means that at the start of the room selection process, there will be a discrete
  and agreed upon number of available rooms, and each one will have a set capacity.
